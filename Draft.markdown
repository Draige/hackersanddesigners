Hackers & Designers public summer program
--------------------------------------

Hackers & Designers is a non-profit cross-disciplinary community of technologists, designers, and artists. 
During the summer of 2015 Hackers & Designers invited an international group of ambitious participants for a 10 full-day immersive program of hands-on workshops in which the focus lies on learning by creating, researching, and discussing. 

(DIY, learning by making, materialization of thoughts… critical discourse while making and experimenting, speculating… not goal oriented.) 

In addition the H&D Summer Academy will host one public screening and one evening of talks.

Hackers & Designes Summer Talks
-------------------------------

Following up on the critical discourse during the Summer Academy  H&D invites speakers from different backgrounds (art, design, technology, social sciences, …) to elaborate, contextualize and instigate discussions about issues addressed during the summer academy such as privacy, digital labor, open source, user-controlled platforms, algorithms, pattern recognition and anomaly detection, the effects on the digital-self and identity. 

We will see art and scientific practices, which 

and the speculative attempts made to the materialization of thoughts,


I order to contextualize the 

- approach: experimentation and self-initiation, satire, humor 
- content: behavior, the digital self, „the obligation to self-design“, algorithms, big data & discrimination, anomaly detection, 


The public lecture program serves as a concluding convention of the H&D Summer Academy. After a presentation of some of the results from the Summer Academy speakers from different backgrounds (art, design, technology, social sciences, …) will contextualize the hands-on workshop program.

(…) and instigate discussion on fundamental theory, reaching into areas of ambiguities and misconceptions about privacy, digital labor, open source, user-controlled platforms, algorithms, pattern recognition and anomaly detection, the effects on the digital-self and identity.

Notes and stuff:

//
Possible keywords for lecture program:

- Unlearning behavior 

general notes: experimentation without instrumentalisation (talking about self-initiation and the importance of non-goal orientated activities), 
topic: standardizaion, profiling, pattern recognition, anomaly detection > causes new patterns to emerge… 

> Jeremy: the digital self instrumentalization … exploring new behaviors when it comes to self-designs and self representation
	> Stefan: the digital self… selfies and selfies after-lives 
	> Ramon: machines flaws of learning behavior, assumptions and consequences and other problematics when it comes to e.g. cultural diversity  
	> Rosa: The flaws of technology 


Notes: 

- emphasize on DIY culture, practicalities and maybe humor and fun approaches? > reclaiming of the digital realm
- What’s big about big data? > changing practices 
- coexisting autonomous practices –> Digital labor (counter-action) 
- experimentation without of instrumentalisation > sustaining spaces for critical thought without loosing the joy!
- quantified labor in the context of mass production and automation 

- The future of algortihmic work and life 
- „What is the point of all this talk?“— on learning by doing?
> using the lecture to learn and reflect on H&D as a non-profit initiative 

- what spaces can be shaped by the interaction between digital technology and creative practice?



Quotes: 

About Art Hack Day: „The event, though well attended, was criticized by many—including invitee Constant Dullaart, who wrote an open letter explaining his reasons for not attending. He argued that, rather than hyperspeed artistic production, today "we desperately need art that deals with contemporary cultural issues relating to technology and media that has had a chance to ripen outside of this techie neoliberal pressure cooker format."

„a space without tangible results is not necessarily a space without agency“

„how does an independent space resist instrumentalizating discourse while managing still to engage systems of power?“

About the speakers: 

»ЯOSΛ MEИKMΛN
Rosa Menkman is a Dutch artist and theorist who likes to focus on visual artifacts created by accidents in both analogue and digital media. The visuals she makes are the result of glitches, compressions, feedback and other forms of noise. Although many people perceive these accidents as negative experiences, Rosa emphasizes their positive consequences: I believe that these artifacts facilitate an important insight into the otherwise obscure world of media resolutions.
By combining both her practical as well as my academic background, she intends to merge her practice into a grand theory artifacts (a study of glitch ecologies).
