Hackers & Designes Summer Talks
-------------------------------

Hackers & Designers is a non-profit cross-disciplinary community of technologists, designers, and artists. During the summer of 2015 Hackers & Designers invited an international group of ambitious participants for a 10 full-day immersive program of hands-on workshops in which the focus lies on learning by creating, researching, and discussing.   

The Hackers & Designers Summer Academy approaches means and goals as same entities by encouraging self-initiation and experimentation with unusual tools and cross-disciplinary collaborations through workshopping. We believe, in this context, the output is not necessarily as important as the input. 

In this spirit, Hackers & Designers has invited cross-disciplinary speakers to take the participants and the public into a deeper conversation around topics, which have inevitably arose in our modern techno society and will have likely breached over the course of the Summer Academy. Please feel warmly invited to join and evening of learning and unlearning notions such as behavioral pattern and habits when it comes to algorithmic work, life, and even death. 
The speakers promise an informed evening offering insights and diverse perspectives into their research, professional and artistic practices, but all the while maintaining the satirical and humorous approach of Hackers & Designers.

The speakers: 

Jeremy Bailey is a Toronto-based “Famous New Media Artist whose work explores custom
software in a performative context. His work is often confidently self-deprecating in offering
hilarious parodies of new media vocabularies.” (Marisa Olson, Rhizome)
Recent projects include performances for Rhizome’s Seven on Seven in New York,
the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, and Tate Liverpool. His work has been shown widely
including recent solo and group exhibitions at Transmediale in Berlin, Mediamatic in Amsterdam, Museums Quartier in Vienna, Balice Hertling in Paris and The Polytechnic Museum in
Moscow. Recent commissions include performances and exhibitions for FACT in Liverpool,
Turner Contemporary in Margate UK, and The New Museum in New York. Bailey is represented
by Pari Nadimi Gallery in Toronto. (From: mediamatic.net/360327/en/jeremy-bailey)

Quotes: 

About Art Hack Day: „The event, though well attended, was criticized by many—including invitee Constant Dullaart, who wrote an open letter explaining his reasons for not attending. He argued that, rather than hyperspeed artistic production, today "we desperately need art that deals with contemporary cultural issues relating to technology and media that has had a chance to ripen outside of this techie neoliberal pressure cooker format."

„a space without tangible results is not necessarily a space without agency“

„how does an independent space resist instrumentalizating discourse while managing still to engage systems of power?“

About the speakers: 

ROSA MENKMAN
>>>>>>> origin/master
Rosa Menkman is a Dutch artist and theorist who likes to focus on visual artifacts created by accidents in both analogue and digital media. The visuals she makes are the result of glitches, compressions, feedback and other forms of noise. Although many people perceive these accidents as negative experiences, Rosa emphasizes their positive consequences: I believe that these artifacts facilitate an important insight into the otherwise obscure world of media resolutions.
By combining both her practical as well as my academic background, she intends to merge her practice into a grand theory artifacts (a study of glitch ecologies).

Stëfan Schäfer is a designer and researcher based in Amsterdam. His research deals with the conversion of images from representative objects to participative subjects. This includes modes of image production and distribution as well as occuring consequences and shifts of meaning while traversing divers media. At this moment Schäfer is investigating the "compensation of physical absence with virtual presence" and vice versa.
