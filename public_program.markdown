Hackers & Designers Summer Talks
-------------------------------

Hackers & Designers is a non-profit cross-disciplinary community of technologists, designers, and artists. During the summer of 2015 Hackers & Designers invites an international group of ambitious participants for a 10 full-day immersive program of hands-on workshops in which the focus lies on learning, researching, and discussing by creating.   

The Hackers & Designers Summer Academy approaches means and goals as same entities by encouraging self-initiation and experimentation with unusual tools and cross-disciplinary collaborations through workshopping. We believe, in this context, the output is not necessarily as important as the input. 

In this spirit, Hackers & Designers has invited cross-disciplinary speakers to take the participants and the public into a deeper conversation around topics, which have inevitably arose in our modern techno society and will have likely breached over the course of the Summer Academy. Please feel warmly invited to join and evening of learning and unlearning notions such as behavioral patterns and habits when it comes to algorithmic work, life, and death. 
The speakers promise an informed evening offering insights and diverse perspectives into their research, professional and artistic practices, but all the while maintaining the satirical and humorous approach of Hackers & Designers.

**The speakers:** 


PhD researcher Ramon Amaro is part of the editorial team of [Big Data & Society](http://bigdatasoc.blogspot.nl/p/editoial-team.html). Ramon Amaro is a doctoral researcher at the Centre for Cultural Studies, Goldsmiths, University of London, with a background in Mechanical Engineering and Sociological Research. His doctoral research looks at the philosophical dimensions of the mathematical modelling of social processes. Drawing on the theories of Gilbert Simondon, in concert with W. E. B. Du Bois and Franz Fanon, Ramon finds interest in modalities of interrelation generated through statistical and data-driven infrastructures and processes.

Ramon graduated from the University of Essex with an MA in Sociological Research, and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor with a BSe in Mechanical Engineering. Prior to coming to the UK, Ramon was a design engineer for General Motors Corporation and a policy manager for the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Alternative Fuels Division.

Jeremy Bailey is a Toronto-based Famous New Media Artist whose work explores custom
software in a performative context. 

„Since the early noughties Bailey has ploughed a compelling, and often hilarious, road through the various developments of digital communications technologies. Ostensibly a satire on, and parody of, the practices and language of "new media," the jocose surface of Bailey’s work hides an incisive exploration of the critical intersection between video, computing, performance, and the body. The unique terrain of Bailey’s work sits between a collision of the rarefied and the populist.“

Rosa Menkman is a Dutch artist and theorist who likes to focus on visual artifacts created by accidents in both analogue and digital media. The visuals she makes are the result of glitches, compressions, feedback and other forms of noise. Although many people perceive these accidents as negative experiences, Rosa emphasizes their positive consequences: I believe that these artifacts facilitate an important insight into the otherwise obscure world of media resolutions.
By combining both her practical as well as my academic background, she intends to merge her practice into a grand theory artifacts (a study of glitch ecologies).

Stëfan Schäfer is a designer and researcher based in Amsterdam. His research deals with the conversion of images from representative objects to participative subjects. This includes modes of image production and distribution as well as occuring consequences and shifts of meaning while traversing divers media. At this moment Schäfer is investigating the "compensation of physical absence with virtual presence" and vice versa.
