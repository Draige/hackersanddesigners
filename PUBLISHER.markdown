Welcome to Publisher
====================

What is Publisher?
------------------

Publisher is a digital publishing platform based on git in order to facilitate openness, collaboration and editorialization of the act of publishing using the constructs of the software engineering source control.

How does it work?
-----------------

Authors create content using Markdown.  Markdown is an easy to read, easy to write formatting language.  You read about and learn it here: [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

The work flow
-------------

It is extremely easy to publish with Publisher, however it does require some new tools which maybe foreign to non-programmers, namely git and the terminal.

Step 1.
Sign up at [github.com](http://github.com).

Step 2.
Visit the main publisher repository here: [https://github.com/bgraves/publisher](https://github.com/bgraves/publisher).  Click the "Fork" button.
